# HuggingFive :raised_hand_with_fingers_splayed:
HuggingFive is a collection of ML functions and libraries written in C and RISC-V assembly. This includes neural network layers, activation functions, as well as entire neural networks. Think of it as a low-level HuggingFace for RISC-V assembly code.  The hope is to eventually roll all these handwritten tricks into the existing compiler toolchains (or have AI generate even better assembly code).
